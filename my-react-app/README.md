## 📌 About This Project
  My binary calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using binary numbers.
It not only computes the result but also provides step-by-step explanations showing how each operation works in binary.
This makes it useful both for quick calculations and for learning how binary arithmetic really happens.
